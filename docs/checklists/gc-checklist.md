# Garbage Collector Checklist - Modern Engine Approach

## Phase 1: Basic Mark-and-Sweep GC (Current)
- [x] Basic object tracking system
- [ ] Root scanning from stack, registers, and globals
- [ ] Mark phase: Traverse and mark all reachable objects
- [ ] Sweep phase: Collect and deallocate unreachable objects
- [ ] Handle object references during marking
- [ ] Memory leak detection and prevention
- [ ] Basic performance metrics collection

---

## Phase 2: Generational GC (V8/JavaScriptCore Inspired)
### Young Generation (Nursery)
- [ ] Eden space allocation for new objects
- [ ] Survivor spaces (From/To) for object promotion
- [ ] Minor GC: Fast collection of young objects only
- [ ] Object age tracking and promotion thresholds
- [ ] Memory layout optimization for young objects
- [ ] Write barriers for cross-generation references

### Old Generation
- [ ] Tenured space for long-lived objects
- [ ] Major GC: Full heap collection when needed
- [ ] Memory compaction and defragmentation
- [ ] Large object space for big allocations
- [ ] Reference counting for immediate cleanup

---

## Phase 3: Advanced GC Features (Production Ready)
### Incremental GC
- [ ] Incremental marking to reduce pause times
- [ ] Concurrent marking threads
- [ ] Write barriers for incremental updates
- [ ] Tri-color marking algorithm
- [ ] Incremental sweeping

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Memory pool allocation for small objects
- [ ] Bump pointer allocation in nursery
- [ ] Card table for cross-generation references
- [ ] Remembered sets for old generation
- [ ] GC scheduling based on allocation rate

### Memory Management
- [ ] Heap size growth and shrinking
- [ ] Memory pressure detection
- [ ] GC frequency tuning
- [ ] Memory usage statistics and reporting
- [ ] Out-of-memory handling

---

## Phase 4: Production Features (V8/SpiderMonkey Level)
### Concurrent GC
- [ ] Background marking threads
- [ ] Concurrent sweeping
- [ ] Thread-safe object allocation
- [ ] Lock-free data structures
- [ ] GC coordination with mutator threads

### Advanced Algorithms
- [ ] Compacting GC for memory defragmentation
- [ ] Copying GC for nursery
- [ ] Reference counting with cycle detection
- [ ] Weak references and finalization
- [ ] Memory prefetching for better cache locality

### Monitoring and Debugging
- [ ] GC event logging and profiling
- [ ] Memory leak detection tools
- [ ] Heap snapshots and analysis
- [ ] GC pause time monitoring
- [ ] Performance regression detection

---

## Phase 5: Specialized Optimizations
### Web/Node.js Optimizations
- [ ] DOM object lifecycle management
- [ ] Event listener cleanup
- [ ] Timer and callback cleanup
- [ ] Module unloading support
- [ ] Worker thread memory isolation

### Mobile/Embedded Optimizations
- [ ] Memory-constrained GC tuning
- [ ] Battery-aware GC scheduling
- [ ] Low-latency GC for UI responsiveness
- [ ] Memory pressure adaptation
- [ ] Background app memory management

## Implementation Notes

### Design Principles (Based on V8/JavaScriptCore)
- **Low latency first**: Minimize GC pause times
- **Memory efficiency**: Balance memory usage vs performance
- **Scalability**: Handle large heaps efficiently
- **Predictability**: Consistent GC behavior

### Performance Targets
- **Minor GC**: < 1ms pause time
- **Major GC**: < 10ms pause time
- **Memory overhead**: < 10% of heap size
- **Throughput**: > 95% of non-GC performance

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for each GC phase
- [ ] Integration tests with VM
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Memory leak stress tests
- [ ] Concurrent access tests
- [ ] Real-world application testing
